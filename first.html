            is a former South African rugby union player whose usual position was on the wing,<br> although he also played as the centre.

             before he was loaned out to the Blue Bulls for two seasons and eventually <br>bought outright by the Pretoria-based side. However,
              he spent the bulk of his career in Pretoria, where he played for the <br>Bulls in the international Super Rugby competition as well 
              as the Blue Bulls in the Currie Cup and Vodacom Cup competition. <br>In 2005, he made his Super 12 debut for the Bulls against the Cats.
            
            In 2004, he was included in the South Africa Sevens side that <br>competed at the IRB Sevens World Series in Bordeaux and London. 
            He also represented the Springboks in 2006 and 2007, and 
            was part of the victorious 2007 Rugby World Cup squad.[1] .</b><br><b>I stay in Gugulethu I am 22 years old.</b></p>

            <b>He announced his retirement at the conclusion of the 2015 Super Rugby season,<br> having made in excess of hundred appearances for the Bulls in Super Rugby and a similar amount <br> in domestic rugby with the Blue Bulls, Border Bulldogs and Mighty Elephants.[2]

            He is the twin brother of winger Odwa Ndungane, who spent most of his career in Durban with the Sharks.</b>
